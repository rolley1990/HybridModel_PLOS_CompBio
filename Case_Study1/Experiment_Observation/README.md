These scripts are to generate in silico experimental observations used in Case Study 1. Specifically, this folder has three files, where
1. 
2. case_det.m is the true system that is used to simulate the in silico experimental observations.
3. case_det_wrong.m is the inaccurate model whose prediction accuracy will be corrected by adding correction terms later on.
